# Respository Naming Guide
Principles to keep in mind when naming a repository:

1. Follow the convention of Camel Case - **Capitilize Every Word In The Title**
2. All repositories should include a prefix that indicates the repository type. Current prefixes:

    2.1. **JournalArticle** - code that follows a published article. Followed up by the complete name of the article, e.g. ```JournalArticle-Systemic-Gendering-In-Facebook-Group-Participation```
    
    2.2. **Specific umbrella project should have the prefix of that umbrella project**, e.g ```NGI-Twitter-Hashtags``` is a project under the funding for Next Generation Internet initiative
3. Prefer creating a more elaborate title vs a less elaborate one: instead of saying ```NGI-Twitter-Hashtags```, use ```NGI-Twitter-Hashtags-Network-Analysis-And-Sentiment-Analysis```
